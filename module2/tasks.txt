Task 2: Skip Multiples of 5
Create a PHP script that prints numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. However, when the
loop encounters a multiple of 5, it should skip that number using the continue statement and
continue to the next iteration.



Task 3: Break on Condition
Write a PHP program that calculates and prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers. But, if a
Fibonacci number is greater than 100, break out of the loop using the break statement.



Task 4: Fibonacci Series printing using a Function
Write a PHP function to print the first 15 numbers in the Fibonacci series. You should take
this 15 as an argument of a function and use a for loop to generate these numbers and print
them by calling the function.
